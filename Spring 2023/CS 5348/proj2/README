The script is run, just by running the 'execute' script.
Namely, `./execute`. This will clean the directory
if necessary and make the corresponding 'computer.exe' file necessary to run
the code. It will then take in input from comp.in (a sample comp.in) file is
provided and then write out to comp.out. It will also run computer.exe
while taking in input from comp.in and pipe the command to the 'wc' command.
