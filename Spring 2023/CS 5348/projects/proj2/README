The script is run, just by running the 'execute' script.
Namely, `./execute`. This will clean the directory
if necessary and make the corresponding 'computer.exe' file necessary to run
the code. It will then take in input from comp.in (a sample comp.in) file is
provided and then write out to comp.out. It will also run computer.exe
while taking in input from comp.in and pipe the output to the 'wc' command.

Alternatively you can run this script simply by running `./computer.exe`
or by piping in input from comp.in by running `./computer.exe < comp.in`.
A sample 'comp.in' file is provided for your convenience and some additional
test scripts 

Assuming that concurrency control is not expected for this project, the
code results in segmentation fault sporadically, due to a lack of concurrency
control, but also completes sporadically.
